This project delivers a HTTP-based Git repository server.

## Deploy the WAR file

Deploy the WAR file on your Servlet container / application server as per the
instructions of your vendor.

## Verify the server is up and running

To verify the container is up and running execute the command below:

```
git clone http://localhost:8080/repositories/test.git
```

You should see output similar to below:

```
Cloning into 'test'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

Congratulations you are now running Manorrock Aegean!

## What is passive mode?

A project can go into passive mode for either of two reasons. Either the project
is feature complete and no active development is needed. Or the project is no
longer considered a priority. Whatever the reason the end result is the same.

This means:

1. No more scheduled monthly releases.
2. If a bug is filed it is addressed on a best effort basis.
3. No new features are anticipated.
4. Releases are only cut on a needs basis and not more than once a month.
5. If you want your bug or feature to receive attention sponsoring is your best bet.
